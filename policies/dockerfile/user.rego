package dockerfile.user

# USER INSTRUCTION — no running as root
#
# WHAT: Ensures at least one USER instruction exists so the container
# does not run as root.
#
# WHY: Agents generate Dockerfiles that run as root by default. A container
# escape vulnerability gives the attacker root on the host. CIS Docker
# Benchmark 4.1 requires non-root users.
#
# WITHOUT IT: Containers run as root — one exploit away from full host
# compromise. Every security scanner will flag it.
#
# FIX: Add `USER nonroot` (or another non-root user) near the end of
# the Dockerfile, after installing dependencies.
#
# Input: flat array of Dockerfile instructions [{Cmd, Flags, Value, Stage}, ...]
