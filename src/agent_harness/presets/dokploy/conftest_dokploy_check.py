"""
Conftest Dokploy check.

WHAT: Runs conftest on docker-compose files with bundled Dokploy policies
covering Traefik label requirements and network attachment.

WHY: Agents add Traefik routing labels but forget `traefik.enable=true`
(silent 404 — traefik-ts has exposedbydefault=false) or forget to attach
services to `dokploy-network` (silent 502 — Traefik can't reach the service).

WITHOUT IT: Silent 404s and 502s that take hours to debug because the
labels "look correct."

FIX: Read the specific conftest violation messages — each maps to a concrete
compose file change (add `traefik.enable=true`, add `dokploy-network`).

REQUIRES: conftest (via PATH)
