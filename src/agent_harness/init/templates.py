## Dev Commands

```bash
make lint          # agent-harness lint (runs all checks, safe anytime)
make fix           # auto-fix formatting, then lint
make test          # run tests{coverage_note}
make check         # full gate: lint + test{coverage_diff_note}
```

## Workflow

Pre-commit hooks run `agent-harness fix` and `agent-harness lint` automatically on every commit.
Before declaring work done, always run `make check` — it's the full quality gate.{coverage_diff_workflow}

## Never

- Never truncate lint/test output with `| tail` or `| head` — output is already optimized
- Never skip `make check` before declaring a task complete
