package dockerfile.healthcheck

# HEALTHCHECK — orchestrator liveness detection
#
# WHAT: Ensures at least one HEALTHCHECK instruction exists in the Dockerfile.
#
# WHY: Without healthchecks, orchestrators can't detect unhealthy containers.
# Load balancers route traffic to dead services. Deployments report success
# while the app crashes in a loop. CIS Docker Benchmark 4.6 / Trivy DS-0026.
#
# WITHOUT IT: Silent failures — service is down but everything reports green.
# Rolling deployments replace healthy containers with broken ones.
#
# FIX: Add `HEALTHCHECK CMD curl -f http://localhost:<port>/health || exit 1`
# (or a similar probe) to the Dockerfile.
#
# Input: flat array of Dockerfile instructions [{Cmd, Flags, Value, Stage}, ...]
