package dockerfile.base_image

# BASE IMAGE — no Alpine for musl-sensitive stacks
#
# WHAT: Warns when Alpine base is used with Python, Node, or Ruby stacks
# that have musl libc compatibility issues.
#
# WHY: Agents pick Alpine because it's small, but musl libc breaks native
# extensions in Python/Node/Ruby. Packages with C bindings (numpy, bcrypt,
# sharp) either fail to build or crash at runtime.
#
# WITHOUT IT: Runtime crashes from C extension incompatibility that only
# surface in production. Works in dev, breaks in the container.
#
# FIX: Use a -slim (Debian) variant instead of Alpine
# (e.g., python:3.12-bookworm-slim, node:22-bookworm-slim).
#
# Input: flat array of Dockerfile instructions [{Cmd, Flags, Value, Stage}, ...]
