package compose.volumes

# COMPOSE VOLUMES — no bind mounts in production
#
# WHAT: Ensures no service uses bind mount volumes (host path:container path).
#
# WHY: Bind mounts require the file/directory to exist at the exact path on the
# host. This breaks with: (a) remote Docker hosts, (b) deployment platforms that
# wipe working directories on redeploy, (c) any system that deploys the compose
# file without the surrounding directory structure.
#
# WITHOUT IT: Deployments silently fail or use stale config files from previous
# deploys. Works locally, breaks in production. Debugging takes hours.
#
# FIX: Use named volumes for persistent data, envsubst templates baked into
# images for config, or `command: sh -c 'cat > /path ...'` for third-party images.
#
# Input: parsed docker-compose YAML
