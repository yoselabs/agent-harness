# Agent Harness — harness engineering for AI agents

Single CLI that detects project stacks, runs all quality checks, audits harness completeness, and initializes new projects. Your Makefile delegates to it — `make lint` calls `agent-harness lint`.

## The problem

AI agents generate code in loops. Without deterministic controls, each loop can introduce new problems — misconfigurations, missing healthchecks, bad Dockerfile layering, secrets in git. The agent doesn't know it broke something unless something tells it.

Agents need tight feedback loops: write code, harness catches errors, agent reads errors, agent fixes. The tighter and more deterministic the feedback, the more effective the agent. That's what this tool provides.

## Quick start

```bash
# Install
uv tool install agent-harness  # or: pip install agent-harness

# Audit your project
agent-harness audit

# Initialize harness
agent-harness init

# Run all checks (<1s)
agent-harness lint

# Auto-fix then lint
agent-harness fix
```

## What's inside

32 Rego policies across 4 categories, plus external tool orchestration.

**Dockerfile** (7 rules) — layer ordering, cache mount usage, Alpine/musl detection, USER directive, HEALTHCHECK, secrets in ENV/ARG, base image pinning.

**Docker Compose** (10 rules) — build directives in prod, image pinning, implicit `:latest`, healthchecks on long-running services, restart policies, port binding, `$$` escaping, hostname configuration.

**Python / pyproject.toml** (14 rules) — ruff output-format and line-length, coverage thresholds, pytest configuration, test isolation (no hardcoded paths, no `sleep` in tests).

**.gitignore** (1 rule) — secrets and artifacts (`.env`, `.venv`, `__pycache__`).

## Tool stack

Agent Harness orchestrates external tools — it doesn't embed them:

- **conftest** — runs the bundled Rego policies against project files
- **hadolint** — Dockerfile linting (DL/SC rules)
- **yamllint** — YAML syntax and style
- **ruff** — Python linting and formatting
- **ty** — Python type checking

If ruff, ty, or yamllint aren't globally installed, agent-harness falls back to `uv run` to invoke them.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- conftest (required)
- hadolint (required for Docker projects)
- ruff, ty, yamllint — used via `uv run` fallback if not globally installed

## Configuration

Place a `.harness.yml` in your project root. If absent, stacks are auto-detected from file presence.

```yaml
stacks:
  - python
  - docker

python:
  coverage_threshold: 95
  line_length: 140
  max_file_lines: 500

docker:
  own_image_prefix: "myorg/"
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `detect` | Detect project stacks (Python, Docker, etc.) |
| `lint` | Run all harness checks — exits non-zero on failure |
| `fix` | Auto-fix what's fixable (ruff format/fix), then lint |
| `init` | Scaffold harness config files onto a project |
| `audit` | Audit harness completeness — shows what's missing and how to fix it |

## For AI agents: how to use this

Every Rego policy file contains a structured comment block:

```
# WHAT: What this rule checks
# WHY: Why it matters for AI agents
# WITHOUT IT: What breaks in practice
# FIX: How to resolve the violation
```

### The agent workflow

1. **On lint failure:** `agent-harness lint` reports which rules failed with actionable messages.
2. **Agent fixes automatically** — most failures have clear fixes (add USER, add healthcheck, set output-format).
3. **If the user challenges a rule** ("ignore that, it doesn't apply"): read the WHY block from the `.rego` file and explain it to the user before suppressing. The WHY is the agent's argument.
4. **If the user still wants to suppress:** that's their call, but the agent informed them of the risk.

### Never ignore silently

When a check fails, agents should:
- Read the error message (it's actionable — "add healthcheck", "set output-format to concise")
- Fix it
- If unsure, read the `.rego` file's WHY block for context
- If the user says "skip it," cite the WHY and WITHOUT IT before proceeding

The policies exist because agents make these specific mistakes. The WHY explains which mistake and what breaks.

## Philosophy: what is a harness?

A harness is a set of deterministic controls that produce pass/fail verdicts without human judgment. Not best practices. Not guidelines. Not conventions. Tools that run the same way every time, return the same result for the same input, and tell the agent exactly what's wrong.

An agent can't act on "consider using healthchecks." It can act on "FAIL: services.api missing healthcheck — add `healthcheck:` block."

That's the difference between documentation and a harness.
